- If it is not written down, it does not exist.
- What an architect really needs is guidance in which architecture and its stake-holders are first-class citizens.
- Concentrate on the information you need to capture, and the figure out how to capture it using an available tool. 
-  The software architecture of a computing system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.
	-  **{Elements, Relations, Properties} Partition/Static Perspective**
	-  {Functionalities, Quality Attributes} Runtime Perspective?
- Architecture is design, but not all design is architecture.
- Architecture decisions are ones that permit a system to meet its quality attributes and behavioral requirements. All other decisions are nonarchitectural. 
-  Doing business without advertising [or designing an architecture without documenting it] is like winking at a girl in the dark. You know what you’re doing, but nobody else does.
-  What to document
	-  Document what is true about all versions of system
	-  Document the ways the architecture is allowed to change
	-  Make your system captures its own architecture-of-the-moment automatically
-  A view is a representation of a set of system components and the relationship associated between them.
-  Pattern vs Style
	- Architecture pattern: {problem, context} -> architecture approach
	- Architecture style: architecture approach
- 7 Rules for sound documentation
	1.  Write documentation from the reader’s point of view.
	2.  Avoid unnecessary repetition.
	3.  Avoid ambiguity.
	4.  Use a standard organization.
	5.  Record rationale.
	6.  Keep documentation current but not too current.
